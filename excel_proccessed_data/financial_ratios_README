1.	Each numbered tab is the year of the data
2.	In each tab, colored columns were added manually
3.	tab "sum" is the processed data we used
4.	The file is backed with formulas to track how each cell in the "sum" tab was calculated.
	In general, the following steps were taken for each year:
	a.	Map the sector in the year's tab to the sectors we use (done manually based on general knowledge)
	b.	Calculate the weighted average for each ratio in the sector.
